# Frontmatter applied to pages that match a glob, before anything else reads them. An ordered list of { match, data }: later rules merge over earlier ones, and a page's own frontmatter always wins. Use it to set a baseline without editing every file — e.g. role for a whole vault, or 'foundry: { journal: false }' for a folder whose pages exist to make compendium documents rather than articles. Applied once, where frontmatter is read, so the wiki, the Foundry sync and the module compiler all see the same page.

# Internal-link preview behavior on pointer (desktop) devices: 'normal' (the default) hovers a preview popover and navigates on click; 'sticky' hovers a preview and pins it open on click (with a 'Go to page' link) instead of navigating; 'none' disables previews entirely so links just navigate.
preview_mode: normal

# Internal-link preview behavior on touch (mobile) devices, where there is no hover: 'sticky' (the default) shows a preview on tap with a 'Go to page' link instead of navigating; 'none' disables previews so taps just navigate. ('normal' has no hover to trigger it on touch and behaves like 'none'.)

# Role assigned to pages with no 'role:' frontmatter. Empty string means the lowest-tier role (typically 'public'). Set to e.g. 'dm' for a private-by-default vault. Must be one of your configured roles.

# Override the accent color (links, headings, highlights). Any CSS color works: '#a8201a', 'crimson', 'rgb(168 32 26)'. Empty = use the built-in scarlet.
accent_color: "#7a1f1a"

# Override the background color for the light palette. Any CSS color works: '#f4ecd8', 'wheat', 'rgb(244 236 216)'. Empty = use the built-in parchment.

# Override the accent color for the dark palette. Any CSS color works. Empty = use the built-in dark accent (a brighter scarlet).

# Vault-relative path to an image used as the site favicon (png/jpg/svg/webp). Empty = generated default with the vault's accent color.

# When a page has no 'image:' frontmatter, fall back to the first embedded image in the body. Used for OG/Twitter social cards, Bases card covers, and Foundry actor/item reskins. Set false to opt out.

# Ship files with unrecognized extensions to every deploy variant. Default false skips them (with a warning) so a stray file in your vault can't accidentally bypass role gating. Recognized media types (audio/video/pdf/epub) are reference-gated like images regardless of this setting.

# How this vault reaches Foundry VTT. 'adventure' packages it as a single Adventure document: import it once and every internal link resolves to the documents you imported, which is what a campaign or module wants. 'compendium' produces browsable compendium packs, one per document type, which is what a reference library wants — you look one thing up rather than importing the lot. 'none' ships no Foundry integration at all: the deploy drops the importer bundle (~60KB) and the /_batch sync endpoints it would never use, for a vault that has nothing to do with Foundry. Pages keep their 'foundry:' frontmatter under 'none'; it simply isn't advertised.
foundry_package: compendium

# Public base URL this vault is served from, e.g. 'https://notes.example.com'. Set it and the build emits sitemap.xml and robots.txt so search engines can index the site; leave it empty and neither is written. Only pages in the default (lowest) role are listed — a sitemap naming gated pages would advertise that they exist.
site_url: ""

# Markdown text rendered in a small <footer> at the bottom of every page. Supports inline markdown (links, *italic*, **bold**). Set to an empty string to hide the footer entirely.
footer: "Generated with [Wizzlethorpe Vaults](https://vaults.wizzlethorpe.com)."
